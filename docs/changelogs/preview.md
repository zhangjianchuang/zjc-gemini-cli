# Preview release: v0.35.0-preview.2

Released: March 19, 2026

Our preview release includes the latest, new, and experimental features. This
release may not be as stable as our [latest weekly release](latest.md).

To install the preview release:

```
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli@preview
```

## Highlights

- **Subagents & Architecture Enhancements**: Enabled subagents and laid the
  foundation for subagent tool isolation. Added proxy routing support for remote
  A2A subagents and integrated `SandboxManager` to sandbox all process-spawning
  tools.
- **CLI & UI Improvements**: Introduced customizable keyboard shortcuts and
  support for literal character keybindings. Added missing vim mode motions and
  CJK input support. Enabled code splitting and deferred UI loading for improved
  performance.
- **Context & Tools Optimization**: JIT context loading is now enabled by
  default with deduplication for project memory. Introduced a model-driven
  parallel tool scheduler and allowed safe tools to execute concurrently.
- **Security & Extensions**: Implemented cryptographic integrity verification
  for extension updates and added a `disableAlwaysAllow` setting to prevent
  auto-approvals for enhanced security.
- **Plan Mode & Web Fetch Updates**: Added an 'All the above' option for
  multi-select AskUser questions in Plan Mode. Rolled out Stage 1 and Stage 2
  security and consistency improvements for the `web_fetch` tool.
