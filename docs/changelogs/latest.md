# Latest stable release: v0.33.1

Released: March 12, 2026

For most users, our latest stable release is the recommended release. Install
the latest stable version with:

```
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

## Highlights

- **Agent Architecture Enhancements:** Introduced HTTP authentication support
  for A2A remote agents, authenticated A2A agent card discovery, and directly
  indicated auth-required states.
- **Plan Mode Updates:** Expanded Plan Mode capabilities with built-in research
  subagents, annotation support for feedback during iteration, and a new `copy`
  subcommand.
- **CLI UX Improvements:** Redesigned the header to be compact with an ASCII
  icon, inverted the context window display to show usage, and allowed sub-agent
  confirmation requests in the UI while preventing background flicker.
- **ACP & MCP Integrations:** Implemented slash command handling in ACP for
  `/memory`, `/init`, `/extensions`, and `/restore`, added an MCPOAuthProvider,
  and introduced a `set models` interface for ACP.
- **Admin & Core Stability:** Enabled a 30-day default retention for chat
  history, added tool name validation in TOML policy files, and improved tool
  parameter extraction.
